# 👋 Hi, I'm Sriram J

🎓 Cyber Security Student  
🔐 CTF Player | Security Enthusiast  

I am a **Cyber Security student** focused on understanding system vulnerabilities, secure web applications, and real-world attack vectors.  
I actively practice **CTF challenges**, explore **web and network security concepts**, and strengthen my problem-solving mindset through hands-on learning.

Alongside my security studies, I also explore **full-stack web development** to better understand how applications are built and how they can be secured.
